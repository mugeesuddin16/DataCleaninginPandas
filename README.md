#ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning with Pandas
---

A hands-on project demonstrating end-to-end data cleaning techniques using Python and Pandas. 
The goal is to convert raw, messy data into clean, consistent, and analysis-ready datasets â€” a crucial step in every data analysis or machine learning workflow.

#ðŸ“– Overview

Data cleaning is the foundation of data science.
Even the most advanced models are useless if the data is incorrect or inconsistent.
This project walks through practical examples of cleaning real-world datasets â€” fixing missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and preparing data for deeper analysis or visualization.
